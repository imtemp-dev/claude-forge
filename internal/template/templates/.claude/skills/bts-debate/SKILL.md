# Expert Debate

Debate the given topic using 3 expert personas.

## Protocol

You will play 3 expert roles sequentially. Each round, all 3 experts speak.

- For "SQL vs NoSQL": Data Architect, Scale Engineer, Developer Experience Expert
- For "Monolith vs Microservices": System Architect, DevOps Engineer, Team Lead

### Round 1: Position Statement
Each expert states their position with supporting evidence.

### Round 2: Rebuttal
Each expert responds to the others' positions. Point out weaknesses, ask questions.

### Round 3: Synthesis
Experts seek common ground. Propose a conclusion that addresses concerns from all sides.

### Decision
After 3 rounds:

- If deadlock: Report [DEBATE DEADLOCK] and ask the user for a decision

### State Management
