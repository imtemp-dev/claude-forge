# BTS Recipe Protocol

## Adaptive Loop

Recipes use an adaptive loop, NOT a fixed sequence:

```
ASSESS → decide action → execute → VERIFY (mandatory) → ASSESS → ...
```

/assess determines what to do next based on the document's current state and level.

## Mandatory Rules

1. **Check for resume first**: `bts recipe status` before starting any recipe.
2. **Edit draft.md in place**: Use Edit tool for incremental modifications, not full rewrites.
3. **VERIFY after every modification**: No exceptions. This includes post-debate and post-simulation fixes.
4. **Log every action**: `bts recipe log {id}` after every step.
5. **Simulate at least once**: Before declaring Level 3, run /simulate with 5+ scenarios.
6. **Debate uncertain choices**: Don't guess. Use /debate for technology decisions.
7. **Adjudicate every debate**: After /debate, ALWAYS run /adjudicate to evaluate the conclusion. Never accept a debate result without adjudication.
8. **Sync-check before finalizing**: All debates reflected, all gaps resolved, all drafts verified.

## Human Intervention

The loop runs automatically. It pauses ONLY for:
- **[DECISION REQUIRED]**: Human must choose between alternatives
- **[CONVERGENCE FAILED]**: Same issues after N iterations
- **[DEBATE DEADLOCK]**: Experts can't agree after 3 rounds

## Completion

### Spec Completion
Output `<bts>DONE</bts>` only when:
1. /assess declares Level 3
2. /sync-check passes
3. Last verify-log entry shows critical=0, major=0

### Implementation Completion
Output `<bts>IMPLEMENT DONE</bts>` only when:
1. All tasks in tasks.json are `done` or `skipped` (no `blocked` or `pending`)
2. test-results.json shows status=pass
3. /review has run (review.md exists)
4. /sync has run (deviation.md exists)

deviation.md is a **report**, not a gate. Deviations and not-implemented items
are recorded for follow-up but do NOT block completion.

### Fix Completion
Output `<bts>FIX DONE</bts>` only when:
1. fix-spec.md exists (fix documented)
2. test-results.json shows status=pass

### Follow-up After Completion
After a recipe reaches `complete`, its deviation.md feeds the next cycle:
- Not-implemented items → new recipe or manual fix
- Deviations → bug fix or spec update
- The spec (final.md) stays alive — it evolves through follow-up work

### Roadmap Progression
If `.bts/state/roadmap.md` exists:
- The recipe's roadmap item is marked done (via /bts-status)
- Session-start hint shows the next pending item
- The next /bts-recipe-blueprint scoping reads roadmap context automatically
